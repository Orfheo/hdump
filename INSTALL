Look to the Makefile for CC,CFLAGS,INSTALL,DESTDIR
variables and customize them as you like.

Do a "make" to build the executable, then
a "make install" to install hdump and manual page
on you local environment.

You may ftp "hdump-1.0.tar.gz" from "ftp.unipg.it:/pub/unix/utils".
Write to "peppe@unipg.it" to report bugs, suggestions
and improvemnts.

Enjoy it.
